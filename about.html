    My Name is Catherine Thy Lê and I am a Vietnamese American visual artist based in Caifornia.

    <br><br>Currently, I am studying Digital Media Art and Studio Practice at San Jose State University. While I do have experience with digital painting, I hope to expand my knowledge to projection mapping, 3D modeling, interactive media and design, and motion graphics while obtaining my BFA in Digital Media Art. With my BA in Studio Practice, I want to focus on expanding my professional experience in the art world via internships and learning about installation art. I plan to use these two degrees to work in the interactive and immersive media installation field. It would be a dream come true to have the opportunity to work with or under the art collective teamLab or any group that creates mesmerizing installations. At some point in my career, I would like to take a step back from full time work to open an art shop that provides space for individuals to safely, freely, and casually explore art and their creativity.

    <br><br>Compared to the composition books filled with graphite horses and the drawings I copied off Pinterest, I believe the work I create now versed in traditional and digital mediums is a far cry from my meek beginning.

    <br><br>As someone easily influenced by the world around me, the images conjured in my mind along with my emotions and experiences, my artwork is diverse in content and imagery. My artwork can be one-dimensional, thought-provoking, nostalgic, imaginative, expressive, ordinary, narrative, unique, or experimental, the possibilities are quite endless and are constrained only by my lack of creativity and articulation. I enjoy exploring topics that catch my eye and provoke me that I have no choice but to focus on and lose myself in them, and I believe the countless unfinished pieces, forgotten sketches, and notes I have are a testament to that.

    <br><br>With being versed in both traditional and digital media, I have no deep meaning or reasoning as to why I use one or the other. Both are compelling and enjoyable for me to use, whether it is video, 3D modeling, animation, painting, illustration, sculpture, etc. I use whichever I feel most compelled to at the time. If I’m learning more about After Effects and filmmaking and a certain topic comes to mind, I will use that medium to convey my idea because it is conveniently at my disposal.

    <br><br>With my work, I hope to form a connection with the viewer- one that is liking the colors I use or causing them to smile, frown, relax, think or get angry. I want my art to be the catalyst for a trivial or monumental moment for my audience because art and creating has been a vital catalyst for me to express myself and escape from reality.

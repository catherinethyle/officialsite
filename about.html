    My name is Catherine Thy Lê. I am a Vietnamese American artist and maker based in California and am currently studying for my BFA in Digital Media Art and BA in Studio Practice with a
    concentration in Spatial Art at San Jose State University.

    <br><br>I am a jack of many trades. I love exploring differents medias and believe all of them provide me with different ways of expression and creation. As a curious and explorative person,
    I pride myself in my flexibility and adaptability to different mediums and learning new techniques and styles of creative expression.

    <br><br>My practice covers many topics near and dear to me, my experiences with life, the world around us, and mundane topics. While art has the capability to explore deep and meaningful
    concepts, there is also a need for it to explore lighthearted and seemingly “meaningless” ideas. I create works that capture the world as I see, experience, and think of it. I hope
    that I can resonate with others with whatever I create, on a surface or deeper level. Art is a strong way to connect with and to others, which I am so grateful to have experienced these
    past few years through my friends, family, and within the art community at San Jose State.

    <br><br>I have experience with 3D modeling (Blender 3D and Fusion 360), video editing (After Effets and Premier Pro), wed development (HTML, CSS, Java Script, p5.js), illustration, drawing,
    painting, embroidery, casting, moldmaking, metalsmithing, and museum and gallery operations and installation. I plan to use these two degrees and experience to work with interactive and
    immersive media installation or wherever else my skills and knowledge are applicable. I want to be able to explore and expand upon what the creative industry has to offer.

    <br><br>At some point in my career, I would like to take a step back from full time work to open an art shop and cafe that provides space for the community to safely, freely, and casually explore
    art and their creativity.

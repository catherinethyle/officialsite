  <p>
    A short video that experiments with camera movement and text animation. With it's ethereal and lulling
    aura, "angel monitors" is a video that is meant to show what society sees as heavenly right now- though
    it is in way an accurate representation on the yearnings of current society since it is based on such a
    small sample size of responses. With "angel monitors", we can take a look into the wants and longed for
    moments that some people in society have and reflect on what we as society hold dear.

    <br><br>I created this piece by asking people on my social media and the school student forum what they
    thing and associate with "heavenly". From there, I picked from the array of responces I recieved and found
    footage that I believe best represented their heaveny desire from a free footage database (pexels.com). All
    the footage and images in this  video were used from that database due to time constraints and not having
    the resorces to film and shoot myself.

    <br><br>This piece is not perfect but I am happy with it considering it was my first time experiementing
    with 3D, camera movement, and keyframes so heavily. When I find the time, I would like to come back to this
    project and do it at a larger scale that shows more responces with footage and sound that I created myself.
    With the larger scale version, I would also like it to become an installation that people would be able
    to walk through, experience, and interact with.

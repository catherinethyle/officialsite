  <p>
    Jade, pearls, and cherry blossoms are some things that are seen as beautiful in Vietnamese culture.
    With “Bà ơi” (which translates roughly to “dear grandma” or "oh grandma" in English), I wanted to
    pay homage to my Vietnamese roots and Vietnamese culture.

    <br><br>Though this piece originates from the memories of seeing grandmas at church with their pearl
    and jade jewelry, I kept Asian elders and the recent attacks on individuals in the AAPI community in
    my thoughts while creating this piece. The elderly often enjoy going on walks and getting their fresh
    air but now feel unsafe to do so with the Anti-Asian sentiment revolving because of the COVID-19 virus.
    With that in mind, I wanted to create site art that would provide a safe space for our community members
    to rest, located under a cherry blossom tree.

    <br><br>If this prototype is able to become a tangible installation in the future, I would like it to be
    installed in a park located in an area heavily populated by elderly Vietnamese individuals and others in
    the AAPI community. I imagine making it so that the jade and pearls light up in the evening to illuminate
    the cherry blossom tree (as shown in the video below) and provide a beautiful sight to see at night and a
    tranquil space to take shelter from the sun's rays during the day. I used my past experience in Blender with
    “Lay With Me Beneath the Gemini Sky” and “BALL” to create a piece that relies on a lot of textures and keyframes.
    I also referenced the work of Beverly Buchanan, specifically her "March Ruins" piece (concrete and found
    elements. 1979), as inspiration for “Bà ơi”. Buchanan's work was understated in the fact that it blended in
    with the site it was placed in. Though this piece is a more flamboyant and not as "natural" looking as Buchanan's
    work in the sense that it seems like it was something that would be on site naturally, I created “Bà ơi” so it
    looks like a circular bench one can sit on and rest at.

  <p>
    Jade, pearls, and cherry blossoms are some things that are seen as beautiful in Vietnamese culture.
    This prototype showcases eight orbs that represent pearls of various sizes scattered among the branches
    of a cherry blossom tree and is enclosed by a bench that resembles a jade bracelet that community members
    can sit and rest on. If “Bà ơi” is able to become a tangible installment in the future, I would like it
    to be built in a park in an area heavily populated by elderly Vietnamese individuals and others in the
    AAPI community. I imagine making it so that the jade and pearls light up in the evening to illuminate
    the cherry blossom tree and provide a beautiful sight to see at night and a tranquil space to take shelter
    from the sun's rays during the day.

    <br><br>With “Bà ơi” (translates roughly to “dear grandma” in English), I wanted to pay homage to my Vietnamese
    roots and Vietnamese culture. While this piece originates from the memories of seeing grandmas at church
    with their pearl and jade jewelry, I kept Asian elders and the recent attacks on individuals in the AAPI
    community in my thoughts while creating this piece. The elderly often enjoy going on walks and getting their
    fresh air but now feel unsafe to do so with the Anti-Asian sentiment revolving because of the COVID-19 virus.
    With that in mind, I wanted to create a site art installation that would provide a safe space for our
    community members to rest, located under a cherry blossom tree.

    <br><br>I used my past experience in Blender with <a href="lay-with-me-beneath-the-gemini-sky.html">“Lay With Me
    Beneath the Gemini Sky”</a> and <a href="BALL.html">“BALL”</a> to create a piece that relies on a lot of textures
    and keyframes. I also referenced the work of Beverly Buchanan, specifically "Marsh Ruins" (concrete and found
    elements. 1979), as inspiration. Though this piece is a bit more flamboyant and not as "natural" looking as Buchanan's
    work in the sense that it seems like it was something that would be on site, I created it so it looks as if it is a
    type of circular bench one can sit on and rest at.

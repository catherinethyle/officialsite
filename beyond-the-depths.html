  <p>
    With "Beyond the Depths", I wanted to show that the hardships that we face throughout
    life have a purpose. The word ‘Strength’ and the
    lion invoke the stability and durability an individual builds for themselves that leads
    to happiness and joyous experiences in life. When you rotate the image, you see the journey
    undergone to obtain said happiness. Through this lens, an individual reaches out, looking
    skyward from the depths of the ocean, surrounded by darkness and cruel words that haunt the
    depths of her mind. But the closer that one gets to the surface, the more light there is.
    Given time, we are able to leave the lonely and dark depths. The ugly parts in life are
    unavoidable. By exiting them, we are able to strengthen ourselves and become happier. The
    orange figure symbolizes happiness, which one obtains through having strength (red) and hope
    (yellow). We must live without fear and unapologetically swim towards the surface.<br><br>
    I designed the lion and birds of paradise in Adobe Illustrator and printed it on
    a type of fabric. From there, I created a piece with a variety a flowers, which
    was my first idea. I went back to repolish that first draft but came up with the concept for
    "Beyond the Depths". It was a tedious process to paint inside of the negative space and, from there,
    to embroider the fabric but I was able to figure it out. This was my first larger scale
    multi-media piece and I would really like to continue to make bigger sized artworks and explore
    other concepts and media.

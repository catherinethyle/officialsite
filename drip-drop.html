  <p>
    In “Drip Drop”, I wanted to create an immersive video installation that revolves around water. Water is something that all living things need to survive and it surrounds us in our daily lives. Water can be beautiful, calming, ominous, fun, the list of its different connotations is endless. With this installation, I wanted to create a calming, soothing, and beautiful representation of what comes to mind for me when I think of water. I used footage of water moving, trees in the rain, fluid water like movement, and the ocean that I found on pexels.com. After collecting the desired footage, I went into Touch Designer to edit my videos to achieve the type of movement and coloration that I wanted. Lastly, I used Premier Pro to add a noise filter onto my videos, to create a type of old school aesthetic.

    <br><br>I decided to display my videos on multiple monitors of varying sizes because the composition is more interesting that way. The different levels that the screens are placed on and the different sizes of the monitors adds a sense of inconsistency and an organic twist compared to a clean cut and uniform presentation (which I also see as how bodies of water are different and varying in shape, size, and look). The addition of the fabric on the floor and wall is to add a solid backdrop to the piece and because the way fabric sits has a fluidity to it that imitates water, which ties back into the concept of my installation. To drive in the overall theme of water, I used a blue light projector that had a pattern and movement that is similar to the surface of water to play over all of my monitors and to play the song “WATER” by Sik-K, Woodie Gochild, pH-1, HAON, and Jay Park that I edited a bit in Audacity and overlaid with the sound of rain that I got from freesound.org. I decided to choose this song because of the repetition of the word “water” throughout and because I really enjoy the sound and flow of it, which tied well with my installation.

    <br><br>In a gallery/museum setting, I would like to keep the set up similar to what was done in this presentation of “Drip Drop”. To keep it so that the fabric flows from the wall onto the floor that the monitors are in the vicinity of and keeping the layout interesting with having the monitors at different levels. The only major change that I would make in how I installed it in a gallery/museum setting would be for the audio to be a bit louder to really make the viewers feel as if they are in the rain. If possible, it would be amazing if I could imitate the smell of rain in space or have it so that there is an actual simulation of rain or some other water source. I would like to have it so that the installation remains intimate, most likely having it play in a small secluded room that views can walk into, take a closer look at the screens, and even sit in and just be immersed in the visual and auditory aspects of the installation.

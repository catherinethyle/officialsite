    For my 18th birthday, I wanted to create a "sef portrait" of sorts. Seeing
    how we has an old wood and glass panel just laying outside, I decided this
    was a sign to experiment with painting on wood and glass. The six glass
    panels show Vietnam, my face, a hand with flowers floating above it, a human
    heart, a cat standing in front of the moon, and feet dipped in a shallow
    body of water. These six glass panels are surrounded by clouds. All these
    panels are representational of who I am. I am a Vietnamese American. This is
    how my face looks close-up. Sometimes I clench my fist when I'm frustrated or
    nervous. I have a kind heart. Some people call me cat and I was born at midnight.
    I enjoy basking in the beauty and calmness nature provides us. My head and
    mind are at times far away, floating around in the vast sky above us.s<br><br>

    At this time, I started to realize how much I enjoyed painting in a style
    with rough brush strokes, something about the texture and strong pressense
    it had was so alluring to me. With my color palette, I wanted to use pastels,
    softer colors to balance out the boldness of the brush strokes. For my first
    time working with glass and wood, I thik this piece turned out quite well. The
    whole process from ideation to execution took some time but I ended p finishing
    everything on my birthday, May 23rd, hence the name of this body of work being
    "Happy Birthday".

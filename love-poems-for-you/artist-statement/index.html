        As a hopeless romantic, love, whether platonic or romantic, is a comforting concept.
        Love can be interpreted and understood in so many different ways, and the same can be said
        for poetry.<br><br>
        I curated a selection of poems that contain "Love" in the title and selected the
        first verse/lines that included the word "love" (i.e. love, beloved, lover, etc).<br><br>
        With this project, I want to allow the viewers to have a playful fortune telling experience with
        love poems, where they can interpret the poems in whichever way they see it and to leave behind and
        take whatever they need from the words that appear in front of them on the screen.<br><br>

  <p>
    "Motherland" is a glitch art piece of 10+ images of Vietnam. Many people think
    of the War when they first think of Vietnam. With this piece, I want to show that
    Vietnam is more than a country where a war was fought.
    It is a beautiful country and the home of my parents. Vietnam is a land of beautiful
    beaches, high skyscrapers, pretty skies, and rich culture. This collage captures
    some of the beauty that is present in Vietnam
    in a colorful and playful manner, while still recognizing the pain, sadness, and scars
    left from the past (i.e. the Vietnam War and poverty). Through this collage, I want to
    show that the “ugly”, though part of the country
    and its history, does not define it. That poverty left in the wake of war does not equate to ugliness
    and despair. That hope and beauty can exist at the “top” and at the “bottom” of the
    social ladder. The Vietnamese people, especially those from the South or Center that were
    greatly affected by the war, are still able to live happily and embrace their culture and
    traditions, whether they are still living in Vietnam or have found refuge elsewhere.

  <p>
    The fast pace of current society has desensitized us from the world around us, making our existence
     seem bleak and colorless. Then again, it all lies within our adopted perspective and mindset.
     If we take a step back, we are able to realize that life is more vibrant and holds more meaning
     than what society lets on. Taking the time to realize the beauty in front of us that we usually
     overlook changes how we take in the world and adds more depth to the life we live and experience.
     Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and the world in which we are embraced by lies within our own
    hands. I would have liked to display this piece in a gallery installation, with it being projected
    (on loop) in a dark room with other works on the walls and floor that connect to the topic of the
    beauty that lies in mundane objects and tasks and that are forgotten because of the rapid pace of society.

    <br><br>In "overlooked vibrance", I made sure to start the video off in black in white with harsh
    sounds, which is how I believe our fast-paced lives and routines feel like. Taking inspiration from
    Nam June Paik's work, I made sure to have a bit of a grainy, VCR look throughout my video and very
    vibrant and over saturated shots in the latter half. I strayed from my initial storyboard and replaced
    some ideas with shots that I belived would stronger enforce my concept.

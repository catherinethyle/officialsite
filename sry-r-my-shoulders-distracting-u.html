  <p>
    "sry, r my shoulders distracting u?" is an acrylic painting of a topless and headless woman whose
    back is turned to the viewers, with the title of the piece painted on her back in white.<br><br>
    In midde and high school, I always
    remember seeing my friends or myself getting dress coded because us showing our shoulders or middrift
    would be distracting to the boys. Why are women's and girl's bodies always sexualized? Why are bod parts
    as normal as your shoulders seem as a distraction to boys and why is that enough of a reason for me
    to change? Why can't you see that my shoulders are not a distraction to anyone? Those were the thoughts
    that floated in my mind whenever I saw someone else, or myself, being dresscoded.<br><br>
    With this piece, I wanted to juxtapose the idea of the woman being topless yet asking if her
    shoulders, not her being topless, was distracting to the viewer. I wanted to cause the viewer
    to rethink what society has taught us about women and our bodies. It can also be taken as me
    taunting the patriarchy and how it has sexualized and objectified women in society for so long
    and how it's completely ridiculous.

    <p>
    As a first generation Vietnamese American, I did not expect to attend school
    to become an artist. It was always drilled into my head when growing up to become a
    “useful member” of society by being in the medical field, becoming an engineer,
    or taking on law. It took me until college application season my senior year to
    realize that I did not want to go down that path but to follow my love for the arts
    and creating. I have come to realize that each occupation has a vital role to play
    in society and that creating art would be mine.<br><br>

    I am a visual artist and use both traditional and digital mediums in order to
    create artwork inspired by what I see in the world around me and ideas that are
    born in my mind. While having no consistency among the subject matter of my work,
    I take pride in the versatility of what I am able to produce and bring to the table.
    All the work I create is made with a purpose-
    whether it be for the purpose of paying homage to something I like, feeling obligated
    to constantly create, letting go of my emotions, expressing my ideas, or responding to
    the world around me, my work has some sort of stimuli behind it, no matter how trivial
    or demanding it may be.<br><br>

    Currently, I am studying Digital Media Art and Studio Practice at San Jose State
    University and hoping to acquire a Business Minor as well. While I do have experience
    with digital painting, I hope to expand my knowledge to projection mapping, 3D modeling,
    interactive media and design, and motion graphics while obtaining my BFA in Digital Media Art.
    With my BA in Studio Practice, I want to focus on expanding my professional experience in the
    art world via internships and learning about installation art. I plan to use these two degrees
    to work as an Immersive Digital/New Media Installation Artist. It would be a dream come true to
    have the opportunity to work with or under the art collective teamLab or any team that creates
    mesmerizing installations.<br><br>

    Upon somewhat establishing a name for myself within the art community, I hope to take a step
    back from being a full-time installation artist to open up my own art shop. I want to create
    a space that gives individuals an opportunity to informally explore and navigate their artistic
    abilities and create artwork in a safe and welcoming environment. Not only that, I want my shop
    to be a place to showcase and sell my own artwork and to provide a venue for other artists to do
    the same thing. I want to be able to help uplift other artists and create a space for us to do
    what we love.<br><br>

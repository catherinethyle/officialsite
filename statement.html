    Artist Statement
  </h1>

  <p>
    As someone who is easily moved by the evolving world around me, I lack consistency in the
    subject matter between each work I create. The world I see through my eyes and the ideas that are
    born in my head are not linear nor do they fit into a single category. That being said, my versatility
    is my strength. Though there is no deep connection between the subject matter behind each piece, all my
    art is made with a purpose- whether it is for the purpose of paying homage to something I like, feeling
    obligated to constantly create, expressing my emotions and ideas, or responding to current events in society,
    my work has some sort of stimuli behind it, no matter how trivial or demanding it may be. I enjoy using a
    wide range of colors in my work. Soft pastels, over saturated hues, and muted colors are my bread and butter.
    I want to bring liveliness into my art that captures the interest of the viewer and demands their full attention.

    <br><br>Currently, I am studying Digital Media Art and Studio Practice at San Jose State University and am hoping
    to acquire a Business Minor as well. While I do have experience with digital painting, I hope to expand my knowledge
    to projection mapping, 3D modeling, interactive media and design, and motion graphics while obtaining my BFA in Digital
    Media Art. With my BA in Studio Practice, I want to focus on expanding my professional experience in the art world via
    internships and learning about installation art. I plan to use these two degrees to work in the interactive and immersive
    media installation field. It would be a dream come true to have the opportunity to work with or under the art collective
    teamLab or any group that creates mesmerizing installations. At some point in my career, I would like to take a step back
    from full time work to put my business minor to good use- via opening an art shop that provides space for individuals to safely,
    freely, and casually explore art and their creativity.

    <p>
      My name is Catherine Thy Lê and I am a visual artist and creative, born and raised in Southern California. While having an interest
      and an attraction to the arts from a young age, I did not think of pursuing art as a career until the start of my senior year. From there, I began expanding from traditional mediums to
      digital mediums for illustration and design. Currently, I am in the middle of pursuing a BFA in Digital Media Art, a BA in Studio Practice, and a Business Minor at San José State University. I hope to grow and expand my knowledge in digital
      mediums as well as broaden my network and understanding of the art industry in my next few years at San Jose State to begin establishing a name for myself in the creative community.<br><br>

      As an artist, I don't limit myself to what I can and cannot do. Digital and traditional mediums are all fair game for me. I use mediums that I find interesting and those in which I would like to refine
      my skills in. The same can be said for my subject matter. I create artwork based off of what catches my eye- whether it's the visuals I see  my day to day life or in my imagination. Recreations and renditions of landscapes, individuals,
      and, objects, are all created through my own lens. With my art, I want to offer the viewer an emotional experience- no matter how big or small. One where they can feel acceptence, happiness, peace, sadness, shock, anger, awe, comraderey,
      and countless other feelings and emotions. I want my art to be a capsule for these emotions and for it to have an impact on the viewer, regardless if it's to the size of a ripple or that of a crashing wave. I believe the beauty of art lies
      within how it is able to connect people who have known eah other thier whole lives or complete strangers who meet at the venue or in the comments section- regardless of their identity and background. <br><br>

      A goal of mine is to provide a space like this for individuals in the future. A place where they can become in tune with their emotions, connect with other individuals, and immerse themselves in the beaty of art.
      To build a paradise of sorts for creative individuals and give those who want to explore and celebrate their artistic endevors a place to shine and find comfort in. I want to pursue, create, and present my own artwork
      and the artwork of others for the rest of my life and to show people the beauty and impact that art and creativity hold.

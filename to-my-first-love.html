  <p>
  “To my first love...” is a reminiscent video on what it feels like as a young person to experience your first romantic love. With a dreamy and warm aesthetic, I want to take the viewer through the memories of the main character, who is thinking back to the first romantic love they experienced as a teenager. The video plays through narrative clips that show us the love experienced by the main character as well as abstract shots that follow along to the narration. When thinking of “first love”,
  I imagine a relationship that happened long ago that was pure, innocent, fun, and experimental. I want the viewers to see how the main character was able to clumsily learn and experience a lot through their first love but it ultimately was not a connection that was meant to last- and looking back to it now, they are no longer bitter but accepting of that fact. With this video art, I want to show how beautiful love, more specifically our first romantic love as young people, is and how we should live happily in those moments while experiencing them. How our cluelessness and foolishness when being blinded by love is something that we should be grateful for and think fondly of because it is part of the path that brings us to where we are currently. Music by Joe Hisaishi "TWO OF US". I did not create nor do I own the rights to the music used. I also am not endorsed or connected to the artist in any way, shape, or form. Used for fair use and non-commercially.

  <br><br>With "To my first love..." I wanted to challenge myself with acting, capturing aesthetic shots, and doing a voice over,
  seeing that I have never done anything like this before. It was chalenging to get the the scenes right and I underestimated the
  amount of time and resources that go into filming, but I was able to wrk with what I got. I'm happy with the hazy and dreamy look
  that I was able to acheive through my editing and the soothing feel my dialouge added to the video.

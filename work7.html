    <br>Growing up, I remember always seeing Vietnamese grandmas at church wearing jade
    bracelets and pearl earrings with their áo dài (Vietnamese traditional dresses) on
    special holidays. But these two gemstones are not limited to the jewlery boxes of
    older Vietnamese women, but many Vietnamese individuals. Jade, pearl, and cherry
    blossoms are some things that are seen as beautiful in Vietnamese culture. With this
    piece, I wanted to pay homage to my Vietnamese roots and Vietnamese culture.

    <br><br>As mentioned before, I first thought of Vietnamese grandmas,
    which led to thinking of Asian elders and the recent attacks on individuals in the
    AAPI community. I know the elderly often enjoy going on walks and getting their fresh
    air and now feel unsafe to do so with the Anti-Asian sentiment revolving because of
    the COVID-19 virus. With that in mind, I wanted to create a site art piece that
    would be in a park for individuals to rest, located under a cherry blosson tree. There
    are 8 pearls in the three because eight is a lucky number in Vietnamese culture.

    <br><br>If this protoype is able to become a tangible thing in the future, I
    would like it to be installed in a park in an area heavily populated by elderly
    Vietnamese individuals and others in the AAPI community. I imagine making it so
    that the jade and pearls light up in the evening to illuminate the cherry blossom
    tree and provide a beautiful sight to see at night and a tranquil space to take shelter
    from the sun's rays during the day.

    <br><br>This piece was heavily inspired the work of Beverly Buchanan, specifically
    her "March Ruins" piece (concrete and found elements. 1979). Buchanan's work was understated
    in the fact that it blended in with the site it was placed in. The slabs of concrete
    and tabby looked like rocks that were meant to be in that location, where people could
    just sit and rest on. Though this piece is a bit more flamboyant and not as "natural" looking
    as Buchanan's work in the sense that it seems like it was something that would be on site,
    I created it so it looks as if it is a type of circular bench one can sit on and rest at.

    <br><br>Though I had some prior experience with Blender 3D, I decided to be more
    ambitious and play around more with the software with this piece. I was able to
    expand my knowledge of using Blender's keyframe freatures and nodes with the help
    of YouTube tutorials and clicking around whie creating. Though there were some problems
    along the way, I was able to work around them and learn some new skills.

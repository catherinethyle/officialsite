  <p>
    Seeing so many people on social media baking minimalist cakes and lunch box cakes
    that looked so cute and aesthetically pleasing, I was really inspiried and wanted to
    make one of my own.<br><br>
    "Your Effort is Enough" is an acrylic painting of
    a cake with an affirmation and flowers decorated on it. During the time of its creation,
    I was going through a bit of a rough patch and decided to paint out my emotions.
    It was really therepudic for me roughly finger paint and lesurly add color to this
    painting with a palette knife. The rough stokes, dark and pastel colors, and the
    white text and flowers that were born from my frustrations into a reminder that what
    I'm doing right now and the progress I have made is enough give me a sense of calm and
    peace whenever I look at it.
